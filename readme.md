# NoTeX
Sort of but not really at all like LaTeX, but for music composition.  

NoTeX is a text-based, LaTex based Music score/omposition markdown language.

## Pronounciation
Every good library has a pronounciation section. Well this isn't a good library (yet),  
but it can't hurt to pretend, right?

NoTex is pronounced how you pronounce LaTeX, but it's 'No' instead of 'La'.  

Originally I was going to name it Do-Re-Mi-Fo-So-LaTeX, but I figured it was presumptious of  
me to assume that 'La' would be read as 'La' as in 'Large' instead of as in 'Lays: The water  
equivalent of potato chips.'
