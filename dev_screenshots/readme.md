# Development Progress Blog

Sometimes working on a project gets discouraging and I need to remind myself how far I've come.  
Sometimes I want to make sure I don't get too lost in adding additional features that I forget what the  
original intentions of the project was.  
Sometimes I just want to later show off how I built something from scratch.
Either way this is a series of screenshots and captions displaying some key milestones in the development of this project.
